### GDRtheBlackTower


Hello and welcome to a new brand GDR, created using Javascript and NodeJS!

# The black Tower allows you to choose one of three characters, the bard, the barbarian and the mage.

Each one of them has a different XP amount and personalised lines throughout the game.
To run the game I recommend to install the Chalk package by typing "npm i chalk@4.1.2" in the terminal.
To select an option use numerical buttons 1 ,2 , 3 and 4. Yes and No option are available typing "y" or "n".
Good luck and have fun!
